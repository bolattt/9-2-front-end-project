# Box News 

It's a news website using [news api](https://newsapi.org/). 

It displays top headlines upon visiting the home page. 

There are different headings on the homepage and a search bar. 

When users click a heading or make a  search, it will make a fetch request and repaint the dom. 

--- 

News api only enables CORS for localhost. 

So, I setup a basic backend server to bypass CORS issues. 

It's deployed on [render](https://render.com).

Please be patient when visiting the page for the first time. 

Backend server takes a while to wake up.
