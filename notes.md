## How to hide public api key 

Didn't figure that out. 

## Authorization 

For Marvel API,Even after adding api key to the query string, it is sill not authorized. Had to authorize localhost on marvel api settings.

## Response Type 

I was fetching data from waifuai. I was calling .json() on response object and logging  but it's not logging anything to the console.
Turns out response type wasn't json. 
Took me a few hours to figure out use response.text().

## API that didn't get used 

Wanted to do car related project. After searching with VIN, it would show specs, recall info, current market value, and mainteneace by mileage, owner manual  but APIs has very low limits for free tier.
